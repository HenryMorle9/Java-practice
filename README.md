# Java-practice

## Purpose of this personal repository

After recently graduating, I’ve come to the realization that constantly debugging with AI and using it for boilerplate code has started to erode my coding muscle memory. In university, it was easy to justify this. The workload was high, deadlines were tight, and the pressure was constant. By my final semester in 2025, almost everyone in the cohort was using AI in some capacity. If you didn’t, your submission was often weaker than those who did.

That environment made sense at the time. You adapt to survive.

But now, as a new graduate, I can feel the impact. I’m starting to lose fluency. That’s a problem. Coding is a skill that requires repetition, and without reps, you get rusty. For someone trying to break into the industry, especially into roles that still rely heavily on DSA-style technical interviews, that’s not acceptable.

I believe it’s important to embrace new technology and stay open-minded. AI is a powerful efficiency tool, and I use it that way — for learning, for accelerating setup tasks, and for handling repetitive boilerplate like configuring Firebase or scaffolding projects. Used properly, it’s a multiplier.
There’s a balance to strike.

AI is a powerful tool, but it shouldn’t replace understanding. I don’t want to drift into a workflow where I can generate solutions quickly but haven’t fully thought through the architecture, trade-offs, or underlying concepts. Tools should enhance thinking — not replace it.

Many companies, especially those that run DSA-style interviews, still assess core fundamentals for a reason. They’re not testing memorization. They’re testing depth of understanding and problem-solving ability. That discipline still matters.

This repository exists to reinforce that foundation.

It’s a place where I deliberately practice core concepts, revisit data structures and algorithms, and keep my problem-solving sharp. I’m not stepping away from AI — I’m making sure I’m using it intentionally rather than passively.

This is about staying sharp, staying in control, and continuing to improve.
